        The main advantage of this git-flow implementation (additional to the pull-reuests before the merge),
        is the centralized configuration file, all the developers workflow will be the same according this conf file.
        
        This conf file is required, please add it to the root directory of your repository before starting work with `git flow`.

          - **rebase** - Rebase the commits onto the base branch
          - **squash** - Squash the commits into one commit and merge it into the base branch
